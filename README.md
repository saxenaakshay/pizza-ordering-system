# Pizza Ordering System
This application simulates ordering system for a pizzeria. Its main use case is to allow the users (customers) to place orders through a visual medium developed using C# in visual studio 2010. 

This project shows ways to implement similar ordering system for any type of system and managing orders and details of customers for future references. 

**Functional Requirements:**
*	The user creates his account on the system by registering himself first. User becomes a customer after registration. The user provides his details such as name, username, password, address, phone no. The user selects his pin code from a list. A unique 4 digit customer code is generated by the system. Details are validated and stored in the customer database. The user now becomes a customer.
*	Employee and registered customers can perform their respective login by entering their username and password.
*	View menu card of the pizzeria. The user, customer, employee can view pizzas and their respective prices according to the size by selecting the category of pizza-type.

*	Customer can place his order after performing login in the system. The customer selects pizza, size and quantity while placing an order. The customer may or may not provide coupon code which gives some discount on the selected pizza.  This is stored in a cart. A customer can place order for any no of different pizzas and finalize his order. A bill may be generated after order has been finalized.
